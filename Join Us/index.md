# <i class="fas fa-users"></i>Join Us!
The projects in our lab are centered around primary patient samples or pre-clinical modeling 
and are highly trans-disciplinary. They are situated at the interface of functional (single-cell) multi-omics, 
computational biology and (spatial) imaging to better understand the principles 
that steer changes in complex multicellular tissues. 
You will be working together with experts in these fields and will have the opportunity 
to be trained in one or more fields to become a well-rounded researcher. 
You will be involved in determining the important and interesting questions, 
creating and improving technological setups, performing experiments, and/or analyzing obtained datasets.

Since our lab atmosphere is highly collaborative we particularly encourage applications 
from individuals that have an open mind and work well in a team setting. 
Each person will have the opportunity to be the chief of their own project(s), 
but will be asked to give and take advice in a positive and constructive manner.

Undergraduate Research Position - Spatial Transcriptomics and Data Science in Cancer Biology

The Dries Lab at Boston University is seeking a motivated undergraduate student to contribute to research projects focusing on various tumors using spatial transcriptomic technologies, imaging and 3D tissue modeling, and bioinformatics software tools. Our lab is situated at the forefront of spatial omics research and develops Giotto Suite [Giotto](www.giottosuite.com), a widely used R package for spatial omics data analysis. We encourage undergraduates with a background in programming, data analysis, and/or cancer biology, as well as an interest for translational research to apply. No prior lab experience is required. The roles offers an oportunity to explore the latest advances in cancer research within a multi-disciplinary lab environment while gaining valuable experience in computational workflows. See [UROP link](https://www.bu.edu/urop/opportunity/computational-biology/) for more information and instructions on how to apply. 
=======
We're looking for enthusiastic postdoctoral fellow(s) with an interest in spatial multi-omics. Ideally, this person has prior expertise in one or more of the following skills:   
- data science / analysis  
- R and software engineering
- imaging  or image processing  
- genomics  
- spatial method development  
- deep-learning

We're specifically looking for talented individuals that want to develop new methods working with large and/or multi-modal
spatial datasets. High-level R coding and package development to support our [Giotto Suite](https://giottosuite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) platform are considered a big plus. In this role the fellow can also directly interact with our excellent (under)graduate students and provide mentorship and support where needed. Each individual will be given the opportunity to carve out an individual growth trajectory that matches their previous expertise and future goals.

If interested, please email a CV and a letter of intent to [Ruben](mailto:rdries@bu.edu).
