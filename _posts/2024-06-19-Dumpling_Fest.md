Many of the lab members gathered at Quynh's new rental for a dumpling folding workshop. Some had the misfortune of missing out on the fun. The plum wine that George brought was finished in 17 minutes. Many mistakes were made, actually, more mistakes than dumplings were made.

The Dries lab should stick to research.
