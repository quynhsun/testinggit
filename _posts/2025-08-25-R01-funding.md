We’re thrilled to share that our lab has received R01 funding from the NIH for our project, “Scalable software engineering and methods for large-scale subcellular spatial omics.”

This award marks a major milestone for our team and enables us to further advance the development of scalable, open, and innovative computational frameworks for spatial omics data analysis—benefiting not only our own research but the broader scientific community. 

Special thanks to our collaborators and co-Investigators Shariq Mohammed and Mark Crovella, who helped shape the proposal.
