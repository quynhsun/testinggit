It was an honor to take part in this year’s BMC Catwalk for Cancer Care event. This inspiring charity event shines a light on the courage and resilience of patients facing cancer every day, and on the dedicated teams working to support them. It’s a powerful reminder that scientific discovery is not just about innovation—it’s about people, and about turning research breakthroughs into real hope and healing.
