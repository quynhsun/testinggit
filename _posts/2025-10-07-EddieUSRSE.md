Congratulations to Eddie for receiving a travel grant AND giving a [selected talk](https://us-rse.org/usrse25/program/talks/#heading19) at the US Research Software Engineer Association (USRSE) 2025 conference. It's great to see that our work on building tools for scalable spatial data analysis through embedded analytical databases is being noticed and appreciated.
